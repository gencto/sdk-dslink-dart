# ChangeLog

* v1.0.2 - Properly forward QOS level changes to nodes when changing an existing subscription QOS level.
* v1.0.1 - Fix bug in list subscriptions for nodes which have been removed and recreated throughout subscription's life.
           This may have prevented list subscriptions from updating full entries. 
* v1.0.0 - Start of changelog tracking. Too many existing changes to list.
